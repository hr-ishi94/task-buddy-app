## Pending Tasks of Assessment

- **Attachment Feature:**
Due to billing issues with Google Cloud Storage, I was unable to implement the file storage functionality on the cloud. As a temporary workaround, I converted files to Base64 format for storage. However, this approach has introduced some bugs that need to be addressed.

- **Drag-and-Drop Task Arrangement:**
The drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging tasks remains incomplete due to time constraints. This feature is essential for improving user experience and task management flexibility.
